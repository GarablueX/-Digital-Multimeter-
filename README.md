# ðŸ”Œ Digital Multimeter (Voltage, Current & Resistance Measurement)

A microcontroller-based **Digital Multimeter** built with the **PIC16F877A**.  
It measures **Voltage, Current, and Resistance** using analog inputs and displays the results on an **LCD**.  
The project is simulated and tested using **Proteus** and programmed with **MikroC for PIC Pro**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Measure **DC Voltage** accurately.
- Measure **Current (Milli Amperes)** using a shunt resistor and ADC.
- Measure **Resistance (Ohms)** with calculated conversion.
- Real-time display on a **16x2 LCD**.
- Built with **PIC16F877A** microcontroller.
- Fully simulated and tested in **Proteus**.
- Includes **schematic, PCB layout, and 3D view**.
